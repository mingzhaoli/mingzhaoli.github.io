<p>Hello, my name is Ming Zhao Li. I was born in China to two loving parents. I moved to the United State when I was four years old. I was born on the 24th of Feburary in 1998. I will be turning 19 this Feburary of 2016. I am currently attending University at Buffalo (SUNY BUFFALO). I am currently pursuing computer science as my major. Before attending college, I attended Brooklyn Technical High School for ElectroMechnical Engineering. I have experience with Autodesk, Java, G&amp;M code, Windows Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have many interests. I have always been interested in interstellar spacetravel, extraterestrial bodies, and other topics related to space. With my education in computer science, I hope to create my own game company and revolutionize the gaming industry.</p>
<p>I am 5' 6'' in height and 130 pounds. I enjoy eating asian food, and meat but am willing to try other foods. I am a kind, generous, and smart indivual who is willing to stand up for the right. I also have a strong craving for knowledge which makes me very hardworking and curious.
